# Atif Zia | FullStack Software Engineer
I am a fullstack Software Engineer. I started my professional career in July-2018 as a Angular 6 developer intern at Fistix Web Solution. After 6 month I moved to VueJs and always try to update myself with lattest technologies. I've worked on ASP.NET MVC, AngularJS,ReactJs, JQuery, Spring Boot, Firebase etc. And this is a never ending process I've done development in Android/IOS. Now I became a fullstack Software Engineer and always looking for tools and technologies that excite me.
